Lua Text Adventure Engine - Very Heavily a Work in Progress

About

This text adventure engine is my first foray into actual C++ programming, so expect the code to be ugly to anyone with any experience...
This project is only done during my free time, so expect slow updates
This is planned so that anyone can just learn the lua file structure to actually create their own Text Adventure and just edit away.
There might be some required C++ code editing to fit a specific purpose, but I am trying to make it so that a game can be solely created from knowing the lua file structure. 

Status

Very very (very very very...etc) early stages, very little implemented yet.

Requirements

Lua - http://www.lua.org

LuaBridge - https://github.com/vinniefalco/LuaBridge

Note: This was programmed on Xcode 6.1.1 (MacOSX). Windows compatibility not yet tested...
