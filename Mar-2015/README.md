March 2015 Code Update

Rewrote the Room cpp and header file (twice actually). After experimenting with various aspects, I ended up with the code posted here.

The main overhaul was the removal of depending on a Room ID, and now loads "Zones". 
Will write some documentation when I get basic functionality (aka, player moving between rooms AND implementing objects).
